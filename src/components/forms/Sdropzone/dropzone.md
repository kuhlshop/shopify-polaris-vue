# Drop​Zone

Lets users upload files through drag-and-drop functionality into a designated area on a page, or by activating a button.

## Properties

* accept

  string

  Default: ''

  A string representing the types of files that are accepted by the drop zone. This string is a comma-separated list of unique file type specifiers which can be one of the following:

  * A file extension starting with a period (".") character (e.g. .jpg, .pdf, .doc)
  * A valid MIME type string with no extensions

  If omitted, all file types are accepted.

* accessibilityLabel

  string

  A label that describes the purpose or contents of the item. When set, it will be announced to buyers using assistive technologies and will provide them with more context.

* disabled

  boolean

  Default: false

  Disables the field, disallowing any interaction.

* error

  string

  Indicate an error to the user. The field will be given a specific stylistic treatment to communicate problems that have to be resolved immediately.

* files

  File\[]

  Default: \[]

  An array of File objects representing the files currently selected by the user.

  This property is read-only and cannot be directly modified. To clear the selected files, set the `value` prop to an empty string or null.

* label

  string

  Content to use as the field label.

* labelAccessibilityVisibility

  "visible" | "exclusive"

  Default: 'visible'

  Changes the visibility of the component's label.

  * `visible`: the label is visible to all users.
  * `exclusive`: the label is visually hidden but remains in the accessibility tree.

* multiple

  boolean

  Default: false

  Whether multiple files can be selected or dropped at once.

* name

  string

  An identifier for the field that is unique within the nearest containing form.

* required

  boolean

  Default: false

  Whether the field needs a value. This requirement adds semantic value to the field, but it will not cause an error to appear automatically. If you want to present an error when this field is empty, you can do so with the `error` property.

* value

  string

  Default: ''

  This sets the input value for a file type, which cannot be set programatically, so it can only be reset.
