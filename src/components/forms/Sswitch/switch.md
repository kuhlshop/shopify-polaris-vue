# Switch

Give users a clear way to toggle options on or off.

## Properties

* accessibilityLabel

  string

  A label used for users using assistive technologies like screen readers. When set, any children or `label` supplied will not be announced. This can also be used to display a control without a visual label, while still providing context to users using screen readers.

* checked

  boolean

  Default: false

  Whether the control is active.

* defaultChecked

  boolean

  Default: false

  Whether the control is active by default.

* details

  string

  Additional text to provide context or guidance for the field. This text is displayed along with the field and its label to offer more information or instructions to the user.

  This will also be exposed to screen reader users.

* disabled

  boolean

  Default: false

  Disables the field, disallowing any interaction.

* error

  string

  Indicate an error to the user. The field will be given a specific stylistic treatment to communicate problems that have to be resolved immediately.

* id

  string

  A unique identifier for the element.

* label

  string

  Visual content to use as the control label.

* labelAccessibilityVisibility

  "visible" | "exclusive"

  Default: 'visible'

  Changes the visibility of the component's label.

  * `visible`: the label is visible to all users.
  * `exclusive`: the label is visually hidden but remains in the accessibility tree.

* name

  string

  An identifier for the field that is unique within the nearest containing form.

* required

  boolean

  Default: false

  Whether the field needs a value. This requirement adds semantic value to the field, but it will not cause an error to appear automatically. If you want to present an error when this field is empty, you can do so with the `error` property.

* value

  string

  The value used in form data when the checkbox is checked.

## Examples

Component examples

### Basic usage

Basic switch

Standard toggle switch for enabling or disabling merchant preferences. This example demonstrates a simple switch with a label, allowing users to toggle a single setting on or off.

Disabled switch

Locked switch with explanatory text for unavailable premium features. This example shows a switch that is visually disabled and cannot be interacted with, typically used to indicate a feature is not currently available.

Form integration

Multiple switches within a form for notification preferences submission. This example illustrates how switches can be used together in a form to allow users to configure multiple related settings simultaneously.

Hidden label for accessibility

Switch with visually hidden label that remains accessible to screen readers. This example demonstrates how to create a switch with a label that is only perceivable by assistive technologies, maintaining accessibility while minimizing visual clutter.

With details and error

Required switch with validation error and contextual details for user guidance. This example shows a switch that requires user interaction, provides additional context through details, and displays an error message when validation fails.

Switch with accessibility label

Switch with enhanced accessibility description for screen reader users. This example illustrates how to provide a more descriptive accessibility label that provides additional context beyond the visible label.

Settings panel with Stack

Group of related switches arranged in a vertical stack for settings configuration. This example demonstrates how to use the Stack component to create a clean, organized layout for multiple related switch settings.
