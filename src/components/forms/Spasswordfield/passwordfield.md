# Password​Field

Securely collect sensitive information from users.

## Properties

* autocomplete

  "on" | "off" | PasswordAutocompleteField | \`section-${string} current-password\` | \`section-${string} new-password\` | "shipping current-password" | "shipping new-password" | "billing current-password" | "billing new-password" | \`section-${string} shipping current-password\` | \`section-${string} shipping new-password\` | \`section-${string} billing current-password\` | \`section-${string} billing new-password\`

  Default: 'on' for everything else

  A hint as to the intended content of the field.

  When set to `on` (the default), this property indicates that the field should support autofill, but you do not have any more semantic information on the intended contents.

  When set to `off`, you are indicating that this field contains sensitive information, or contents that are never saved, like one-time codes.

  Alternatively, you can provide value which describes the specific data you would like to be entered into this field during autofill.

* defaultValue

  string

  The default value for the field.

* details

  string

  Additional text to provide context or guidance for the field. This text is displayed along with the field and its label to offer more information or instructions to the user.

  This will also be exposed to screen reader users.

* disabled

  boolean

  Default: false

  Disables the field, disallowing any interaction.

* error

  string

  Indicate an error to the user. The field will be given a specific stylistic treatment to communicate problems that have to be resolved immediately.

* id

  string

  A unique identifier for the element.

* label

  string

  Content to use as the field label.

* labelAccessibilityVisibility

  "visible" | "exclusive"

  Default: 'visible'

  Changes the visibility of the component's label.

  * `visible`: the label is visible to all users.
  * `exclusive`: the label is visually hidden but remains in the accessibility tree.

* maxLength

  number

  Default: Infinity

  Specifies the maximum number of characters allowed.

* minLength

  number

  Default: 0

  Specifies the min number of characters allowed.

* name

  string

  An identifier for the field that is unique within the nearest containing form.

* placeholder

  string

  A short hint that describes the expected value of the field.

* readOnly

  boolean

  Default: false

  The field cannot be edited by the user. It is focusable will be announced by screen readers.

* required

  boolean

  Default: false

  Whether the field needs a value. This requirement adds semantic value to the field, but it will not cause an error to appear automatically. If you want to present an error when this field is empty, you can do so with the `error` property.

* value

  string

  The current value for the field. If omitted, the field will be empty.
